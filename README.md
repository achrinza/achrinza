### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rifa. You can find a general self-introduction in <https://www.achrinza.com>.

Here on GitHub, I maintain a handful of open-source projects. Some examples include:

- https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback-next - LoopBack 4
- https://github.com/achrinza/node-ipc - `node-ipc` fork

I also enjoy contributing to other FOSS projects as well!
